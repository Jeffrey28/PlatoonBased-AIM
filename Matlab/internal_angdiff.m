function delta = internal_angdiff(x, y)
%This function is for internal use only. It may be removed in the future.

%ANGDIFF Find difference between two angles
%
%   DTHETA = angdiff(THETA1, THETA2) computes difference between angles 
%   THETA1 and THETA2 and returns the difference DTHETA within the interval 
%   [-pi pi]. Positive, odd multiples of pi map to pi and negative, odd 
%   multiples of pi map to -pi.
